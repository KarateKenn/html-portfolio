<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! My name is Kenn and I am learning how to build websites. I work full time, part time in the Army Reserves, 
  and I go to school part time at Kennesaw State University for Cybersecurity. I decided to learn how to build websites
  mainly because I want to use this skill as a side hustle to make a little extra money on the side. Also, with us 
  currently living in the age of technology, websites are definitely not going anywhere which means I can use this skill 
  to be of service to others. Bear with me as I strive to accomplish goal and hone this skill to the best of my ability. 
  Thank for all your support!
