<h1>The Best Movies According to Kenn</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>This is my favorite movie of all time. The plot and the science are amazing. Matthew is a great actor</p>

<h3>Inception</h3>
<p>Leonardo DiCaprio is spectacular in this movie. The ending is always a good debate to have with others.</p>

<h3>Pulp Fiction</h3>
<p>I love Quentin Tarantino movies. He pushes the envelope and Uma Thurman was stunning in both Vol.1 and Vol.2.</p>
